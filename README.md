# MegaMan
Mega Man Unity Alpha

An early alpha Mega Man engine I coded in Unity. It was more of a proof of concept I did to test some theories I had of for creating
animation systems and other 2d sprite based engine ideas. I will not likely continue working on this project.

Feel free to download the source and use it as you see fit. Points of interest include a palette swap sprite shader (Mega Man's weapon
color changing is purely code based, no duplicate sprites). The project also uses a manually coded sprite animation system, being I felt
Unity's default sprite animation system was a mess shoehorned off the engine's 3d animation system.

Unfortunately I did not add many footnotes to my code, as I original didn't intend to share it publicly. But several people have taken
interest in the source, so I decided to upload it. I can not promise any support/assistance. It is up to you to decipher my programming
and put it to use.
